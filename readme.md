## Usage

### Creating a Survey

Creating a new `Survey` is easy! You can build your survey fluently just like 
how you create all your `Eloquent` models in your app.  
```php
$survey = Survey::create(['name' => 'Cat Population Survey']);

$survey->questions()->create([
     'content' => 'How many cats do you have?',
     'type' => 'number',
     'rules' => ['numeric', 'min:0']
 ]);

$survey->questions()->create([
    'content' => 'What\'s the name of your first cat',
]);

$survey->questions()->create([
    'content' => 'Would you want a new cat?',
    'type' => 'radio',
    'options' => ['Yes', 'Oui']
]);
```

#### What type of question supported
- `radio` - Radio option with option to single select option
- `number` - Option to enter number value as answer
- `text` - Option to enter text value as answer
- `radio-and-text` - Option to enter text value as Other and options value will show up as radio options
- `mutliselect` - Option to select multiple values

#### Creating Multiple Sections
You may also park your questions under multiple sections.
```php
$survey = Survey::create(['name' => 'Cat Population Survey']);

$one = $survey->sections()->create(['name' => 'Part One']);

$one->questions()->create([
    'content' => 'How many cats do you have?',
    'type' => 'number',
    'rules' => ['numeric', 'min:0']
]);

$two = $survey->sections()->create(['name' => 'Part Two']);

$two->questions()->create([
    'content' => 'What\'s the name of your first cat?',
]);

$two->questions()->create([
    'content' => 'Would you want a new cat?',
    'type' => 'radio',
    'options' => ['Yes', 'Oui']
]);
```

### Creating an Entry

#### From an Array
The `Entry` model comes with a `fromArray` function.  
This is especially useful when you're creating an entry from a form submission. 
```php
(new Entry)->for($survey)->fromArray([
    'q1' => 'Yes',
    'q2' => 5
])->push();
```

#### By a Specific User
You may fluently specify the participant using the `by()` function.
```php
(new Entry)->for($survey)->by($user)->fromArray($answers)->push();
```

### Setting Constraints
When creating your survey, you may set some constraints 
to be enforced every time a new `Entry` is being created.

#### Allowing Guest Entries
By default, `Entry` models require a `participant_id` when being created. 
If you wish to change this behaviour and accept guest entries,
set the `accept-guest-entries` option on your `Survey` model.  
```php
Survey::create(['settings' => ['accept-guest-entries' => true]]);
```

#### Adjusting Entries Per Participant Limit
All `Survey` models default to accept only **1 entry** per unique participant.
You may adjust the `limit-per-participant` option on your `Survey` model 
or set it to `-1` to remove this limit altogether.    
```php
Survey::create(['settings' => ['limit-per-participant' => 1]]);
```
*Note that this setting will be ignored if the `accept-guest-entries` option is activated.*

### Validation

#### Defining Validation Rules
Add in a `rules` attribute when you're creating your `Question` to specify the validation logic 
for the answers being received. 
```php
Question::create([
    'content' => 'How many cats do you have?', 
    'rules' => ['numeric', 'min:0']
]);
```
*Note that as opposed to the survey constraints, the question validators 
are not automatically triggered during the entry creation process. 
To validate the answers, you should manually run the validation in your controller (see below)* 

#### Validating Submissions
Validate user's input against the entire rule set of your `Survey` using Laravel's built in validator.
```php
class SurveyEntriesController extends Controller
{
    public function store(Survey $survey, Request $request)
    {
        $answers = $this->validate($request, $survey->rules);
        
        (new Entry)->for($survey)->fromArray($answers)->push();
    }
}
```

### Views
This package comes with boilerplate Bootstrap 4.0 views 
to display the surveys and some basic question types. 
These views are meant to serve as examples, and 
may not be sufficient for your final use case.
To display a survey in a card, include the `survey` partial in your views:

```blade
@include('survey::standard', ['survey' => $survey])
``` 

#### Customizing the Views
To customize the boilerplate views shipped with this package run `package:publish` with the `views` tag.
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="MattDaneshvar\Survey\SurveyServiceProvider" --tag="views"
```
This will create a new `vendor/survey` directory 
where you can fully customize the survey views to your liking.
